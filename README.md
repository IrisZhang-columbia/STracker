# STracker
# 1. Description
  We used django to create a squirrel tracker application to track and map squirrels in Central Park. 
  We created a class called sighting in models.py.
  We wrote 5 functions in views.py, namely add, map, sighting, sightings and stats.
  We added paths to urls.py and used html templates to deal with the request.
